<p>Teaching yourself how to code is hard. It takes a good deal of effort, focus and time, but if you have got those resources, you can get it done! There are plenty of skilled computer programmers today who did not go to college to learn to code. A of these folks had other cards up their sleves, like computers at home and had been working with computer code since middle or high school. For the most part, they had some serious resources, but today, those resources are more widely available, you just need to know how to find them.</p>

<h4 id="the-tool-you-need">The Tool You Need</h4>

<p>Today, for ~$200-400 USD you can get a pretty good programming computer. I recommend looking for pre-built laptops with ~4 gigs of Ram and ~2.4GHz processing speed. I would not feel comfortable going below this. You could, and people work with less, but this is where I feel comfortable making a recommendation.</p>

<h4 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h4>

<p>There are two easier ways to learn to code. Free open courses, and doing several tutorials.</p>

<p>Lots of top institutions including <a href="https://www.extension.harvard.edu/academics/online-campus-courses">Harvard</a>, <a href="ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">MIT</a>, <a href="oyc.yale.edu/courses">Yale</a> and <a href="online.stanford.ecu/courses">Stanford</a> have free open online courses, often called OpenCourseware. You don’t get the personalized mentorship, tutoring, a TA, or even the office hours, but you get the material and if you can commit it to memory and study effectively, you can do it. It’s full press all knowledge.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: You need to go in with that get an A in the course effort.</p>

<p>Running through tutorials is very much a hunt, find and assemble enough material situation. But there are plenty of resources available online, and very many tutorials to fill up your noggin.</p>

<p>This is how I began:</p>

<h4 id="cs50-at-harvard">CS50 at Harvard.</h4>

<p>This is the best course I have ever taken. The introduction to computer programming course, <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/">CS50</a>, is eye opening. They teach you the basics very well, it's all set up in a nice package. There is a wealth of material including lectures and TA sections where they teach you everything you need to know. It also feels very supportive. They have worked hard to get the class online and working well. A lot of people worldwide are taking it and it has expanded to include Yale too. If you take it while the actual course is going on, you get a ton of addional educational resources too! But don't let that stop you from getting started now.</p>

<p>CS50 mostly works in C/C++ with a bit of PHP/Javascript, but they cover the basics well and the concepts underlying web and phone app development.</p>

<p>Additionally CS50 has step-by-step <a href="https://manual.cs50.net/appliance/19/">instructions</a> on how to get a virtual machine up and running. This is particularly helpful because it can save you a ton of discouraging set-up time on day 1.</p>

<h4 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h4>

<p>If you want a software development position, you can increase your prospects with a course or two in algorithms. The prerequisites are a year of college <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/">Calculus</a>. At the undergraduate level <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-design-and-analysis-of-algorithms-spring-2015/index.htm?utm_source=OCWDept&amp;utm_medium=CarouselSm&amp;utm_campaign=FeaturedCourse">Design and Analysis of Algorithms</a> from 2015 is the MIT intro to algorithms course. They have others listed, but the name was changed. If you are particularly ambitious, try your hand at a more specialized algorithms course, where algorithms are applied, in Biology or Animation.</p>

<h4 id="web-app-development">Web App Development</h4>

<p>I wanted to learn web app development and Ruby on Rails in particular.</p>

<p>There was a web dev course offered at Stanford called CS142 that taught RoR, which has since been updated to a MEAN stack. I explored it, but it only had lecture notes and projects. That’s enough to push through a course, but wasn’t as full as I hoped.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails is a web application framework built in Ruby. I pointed to the appropriate resources for installing <a href="www.robosto.com/2016/05/23/how-to-create-a-jekyll-blog/#install-ruby">Ruby</a> in a previous Jekyll blog utilizing RVM. To add Ruby on Rails, open up the console and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$ mkdir myrailsapp</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>$ cd myrailsapp</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>$ rvm use ruby-2.3.1@myrailsapp –ruby-version –create</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>$ gem install rails</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>$ rails new .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ve now got a fresh rails installation.</p>

<h6 id="rubyror-online-resources">Ruby/RoR online resources</h6>

<p>If you want to learn how to use Ruby on your own there are quite a few resources. I would start with the free <a href="tryruby.org">Try Ruby</a> Tutorial, then do the <a href="railsforzombies.org">Rails for Zombies</a> tutorial. I would then start with Michael Hartl's <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">tutorial</a>. Hartl does a great job exaplining the basics. To finish off the beginning stages I would now begin with the <a href="guides.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails guides</a>. When I was a novice programmer, I wish I had gone through the work in this order. Reading the Rails guides was a bit more than I was ready for before working through Hartl's tutorial, and having a bit of time to juice up some Ruby/RoR in Try Ruby and Zombies was of great help.</p>

<p>(There are Rails web dev courses available, and Stanford has a course now focusing on a MEAN stack.)</p>

<h6 id="build-something">Build Something!</h6>

<p>The most important step after learning how to use a language is to build something yourself. You can build Amazon for Rocks or Pinterest for shoes. It doesn’t have to be practical, but you need to create something to hone your skills and plug in the gaps between the tutorials and what is practical. You’ll learn about cacheing, new Javascript frameworks like AngularJS and a ton of other important materials to really build something great.</p>

<p>Today there is plenty of information regarding programming on the web. You can choose a language and take tutorials, but there are also bootcamps in every major city that teach you to code quickly and push you to work hard well. I have heard them scoffed at before, but I personally think they are a viable resource. If you study and learn the material, whether it’s from a course, tutorials or a bootcamp you have it. There is not much else to it.</p>

This is a cleaned up version of gaohaoyang's Jekyll theme
https://github.com/Gaohaoyang/gaohaoyang.github.io

a nice alternative is LiXizhi's Jekyll theme (which actually led me to this one)

To use this repo, first install Jekyll
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/

then clone the repo and just hit jekyll serve in the console

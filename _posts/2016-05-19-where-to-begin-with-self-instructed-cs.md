Teaching yourself how to code is not really that hard. It takes a good deal of effort, focus and time, but if you've got those resources, you can get it done! There are plenty of skilled computer programmers from the 80's to today who didn't go to college and are self educated. As I've read, most of these folks had other cards up their sleves, like working with computer code since middle or high school. A lot of them just didn't have an interest in college. For the most part, they had some serious resources, but today, those resources are more widely availabe. 





#### What You Need

A half decent computer. Today, for about $400 USD, you can get a programming laptop. It won't be the fast, and you might get frustrated with it, but it will have the tools you need. That's a lot more than these other folks who self-taught could claim. I'd buy a windows laptop, erase the harddrive and put a linux kernal on it. That means your replacing the windows operating system with a linux operating system. It feels a little bad throwing away the operating system that came with your PC, but you can back it up on an external harddrive or CDs if it makes you feel better. We aren't working in Windows because it's a bit harder for the most part. Generally everything you can do, programming related, in Windows you can more easily do and set up in Linux.

I recommend looking for pre built laptops with ~4 gigs of Ram and 2.4GHz at the minimum. I wouldn't feel comfortable going below this. You could, and people work with less, but this is where I feel comfortable making a recommendation.

#### Gettin gStarted

I recommend starting with OpenCourseWare. Lots of top institutions including <add some links here>Harvard, MIT, Yale and Stanford have coding courses free online. You don't get the personalized mentorship that would help with a TA to ask questions, or even the office hours, but you get the material and if you can commit it to memory, you can do it. It's full press all knowledge. You need to go in with that get an A in the course effort.

I would start with the best course I've taken

#### CS50 at Harvard.

The introduction to computer programming course [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) is eye opening. They teach you the basics very well, it's all set up in a nice package. There is a wealth of material including lectures and TA sections where they teach you everything you need to know. It also feels very supportive. They have worked hard to get the class online and working well and a lot of people worldwide are taking it. They mostly work in PHP and C++, but they cover the basics well and the concepts for web and phone app development.

#### A Sampling

From here pick and choose a direction and courses. I enjoyed learning a bit more about security and structure, although it's very math intensive. 

Cryptography
include tutorial

Web app development
include tutorial

phone app development
include tutorial

#### Algorithms

If you want a job, they want to know you've taken a course or two in algorithms. The prerequisites are courses the first year of college [Calculus](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/). 


Today there is plenty of information regarding programming on the web. You can choose a language and take tutorials. There are even dozens of bootcamps in every major city, that said, these are 6 month crash courses. If you study and push through you can get it done, but you only have a language or skill and I'm not sure how well refinded the concepts are. I don't know how well they transition into paying jobs either, but to each their own.

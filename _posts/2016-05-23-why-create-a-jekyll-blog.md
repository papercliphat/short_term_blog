When I first started developing I didn\'t see the point in a blog. But, when I started learning beyond the basics and troubleshooting through google, or checking out alternative techniques, I often ran into blogs for potential solutions and thought pieces. Most of the time, I wasn\'nt receiving an expansive guide, or a lot of code, but they were almost always a great starting point.  A technical blog I often ran into in my early days was joshsoftware.com





Even after running into technical blogs I figured these were just folks with years of experience; a blog is for someone in their fifth year programming who wants to give back to the community.

So get out there and write posts on the concepts you already know, or even write out the concepts you don't know to find your faults. Worst case scenario, if you want to review something, you can fall back on your own personal body of work and see it again in your own words.

Everyone with a technical blog is just like you and me. They took the intiative at some point, and their skills grew with them to the extent that now we can all use their posts and a resource for our own growth.
